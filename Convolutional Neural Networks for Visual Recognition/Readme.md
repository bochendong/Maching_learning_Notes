Week Question:

1. Training Neural Networks:
   * Why zero-center is needed
   * Why the distribution of activation will be look like that?
   * Why we want unit Gussian and why unit Gussian prevernt gradient not updating?
   * What does $\gamma$ and $\beta$ do in BN?
2. Into to Neural Networks:
   * How do matrix update in backward pass?
  
3. What does batch mean?
